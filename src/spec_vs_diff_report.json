  "summary": "The diff implements chunked video upload with blob storage and public upload access with admin-only deletion. Most requirements are covered, but migration of existing URL-based titles (REQ-10 AC) and retry capability for failed chunks (REQ-11 AC) are not evident in the diff. Additionally, estimated time remaining (REQ-11 AC) is not displayed in the progress component.",

      "requirement": "Existing URL-based titles are migrated or marked for re-upload",
      "reason": "The diff shows removal of URL field from the data model and replacement with blob storage, but provides no evidence of migration logic for existing URL-based titles. The backend changes show the new blob-based Title type, but no migration code or re-upload marking mechanism is visible.",
